## üèÜ Highlighted Personal Projects

- [leukoRight](https://github.com/originates/leukoRight): A web app that uses a custom-built Keras model to recognize and classify white blood cells from microscopic images. It can distinguish between different types of WBCs and identify artifacts and bursted cells. I created this app as a way to explore the possibilities of image recognition technologies and to learn how to develop Keras models from scratch.
- [cashTrack](https://github.com/originates/cashTrack): A powerful tool that allows you to split bills without actually splitting them. It uses the secure and encrypted Signal messenger and an SQL database to create a virtual ledger that tracks your money transactions with your contact. I developed cashTrack as a personal project to simplify my expense management with my partner and to enhance my skills in database and scripting.
- [The Amari Project](https://github.com/originates/the-amari-project): An original and innovative investigation of the potential and limitations of Stable-Diffusion and Textual Inversion as methods for creating and simulating artificial identities through automation. The Amari Project explores the possible implications of this technology for the future of fake news and culture.
- [theScreensaver](https://github.com/originates/theScreensaver): A zsh script that creates a randomized montage of video clips from your media library. It is part of a larger suite I developed for my Home Media server running on Artix Linux. When the user interface is idle for too long, the script activates and selects 100 random 9-second intervals from various video files (mkv, mp4, webm, etc) in a directory. It then appends them to an EDL file and plays it with mpv. theScreensaver prevents screen burn-in by displaying dynamic familiar visuals instead of a static interface.
- [Random Number 3D Wheel in Excel](https://github.com/originates/Random-Number-3D-Wheel-in-Excel): This project demonstrates the creative use of VBA to animate 3D shapes in Excel. I created a 3D wheel with 12 segments; the wheel spins and slows down to randomly stop at a selected segment, which flashes green to indicate the winner. The spinning duration varies each spin, adding suspense and excitement to the animation. This project showcases my skills and creativity in using Excel beyond its conventional functions.
- [HashCheck](https://github.com/originates/HashCheck): This is a program that leverages AutoHotkey (AHK), PowerShell and VBScript to securely open a single-instance Excel file with a verified SHA256 hash. The program bypasses the user macro settings and executes a Workbook_Open VBA script embedded in the Excel file. This program demonstrates my proficiency in integrating different scripting languages and tools to accomplish sophisticated tasks with minimal code.
- [ZipRecruiter 1-Click Filter](https://github.com/originates/ziprecruiter-1-click-filter): A JavaScript program that improves your job search experience on ZipRecruiter. It enables you to filter out jobs that require you to apply on external websites or have low qualification grades. This way, you can concentrate on the most suitable and convenient opportunities for your career goals. This program demonstrates my ability to create user-friendly and efficient web tools using JavaScript as well as my ability to quickly produce purposeful code.

- I also made a tiny contribution to Pytorch which was merged on Oct 3 2022: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/85679 üòÅüòÅüòÅ
