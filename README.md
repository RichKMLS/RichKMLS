## üèÜ Highlighted Personal Projects

- [leukoRight](https://github.com/originates/leukoRight): A web app that recognizes white blood cells with a trained Keras model. It can differentiate various types of WBCs and detect artifacts and bursted cells. I developed this app to familiarize myself with creating Keras models from scratch and to see first-hand what is possible with image recognition technologies.
- [cashTrack](https://github.com/originates/cashTrack): CashTrack is a innovative tool that enables you to split bills without actually splitting them. It leverages the secure and encrypted Signal messenger and an SQL database to create a virtual ledger that records your money transactions with your contacts. I developed CashTrack as a personal project to simplify my expense management with my partner and to enhance my skills in database and scripting.
- [The Amari Project](https://github.com/originates/the-amari-project): An innovative and original investigation of the potential and limitations of Stable-Diffusion and Textual Inversion as methods for creating and simulating artificial identities through automation. The Amari Project hints at the potential implications of this technology for the future of fake news and culture.
- [theScreensaver](https://github.com/originates/theScreensaver): A zsh script that creates a randomized montage of video clips from your media library. It is part of a larger suite I developed for my Home Media server running on Artix Linux. When the user interface is idle for too long, the script activates and selects 100 random 9-second intervals from various video files (mkv, mp4, webm, etc) in a directory. It then appends them to an EDL file and plays it with mpv. theScreensaver prevents screen burn-in by displaying dynamic familiar visuals instead of a static user interface.
- [Random Number 3D Wheel in Excel](https://github.com/originates/theScreensaver): This project demonstrates the creative use of VBA to animate 3D shapes in Excel. I created a 3D wheel with 12 segments; the wheel spins and slows down to randomly stop at a selected segment, which flashes green to indicate the winner. The spinning duration varies each spin, adding suspense and excitement to the animation. This project showcases my skills and creativity in using Excel beyond its conventional functions.
- [HashCheck](https://github.com/originates/HashCheck): This is a program that leverages AutoHotkey (AHK), PowerShell and VBScript to securely open a single-instance Excel file with a verified SHA256 hash. The program bypasses the user macro settings and executes a Workbook_Open VBA script embedded in the Excel file. This program demonstrates my proficiency in integrating different scripting languages and tools to accomplish sophisticated tasks with minimal code.
