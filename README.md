## 🏆 Projects

- [leukoRight](https://github.com/originates/leukoRight): A web app that recognizes white blood cells with a trained Keras model. It can differentiate various types of WBCs and detect artifacts and bursted cells. I developed this app to familiarize myself with creating Keras models from scratch and to see first-hand what is possible with image recognition technologies.
- [cashTrack](https://github.com/originates/cashTrack): A tool that helps you split bills without splitting them. It uses Signal messenger and an SQL database to send and receive money virtually via an electronic ledger. I created cashTrack to simplify the process of splitting expenses with my partner and to practice my database and scripting skills. I also learned how to effectively prompt engineer OpenAI language models to generate useful code quickly.
- [The Amari Project](https://github.com/originates/the-amari-project): An innovative and original investigation of the potential and limitations of Stable-Diffusion and Textual Inversion as methods for creating and simulating artificial identities through automation. The Amari Project hints at the potential implications of this technology for the future of fake news and culture.
- [theScreensaver](https://github.com/originates/theScreensaver): A zsh script that creates a randomized montage of video clips from your media library. It is part of a larger suite I developed for my Home Media server running on Artix Linux. When the user interface is idle for too long, the script activates and selects 100 random 9-second intervals from various video files (mkv, mp4, webm, etc) in a directory. It then appends them to an EDL file and plays it with mpv. theScreensaver prevents screen burn-in by displaying dynamic familiar visuals instead of a static user interface.
