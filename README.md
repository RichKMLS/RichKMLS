Hi!, I'm a technical specialist, AI/ML enthusiast and certified Medical Laboratory Scientist. I use data analysis, automation, and AI to solve complex problems and work on creative projects.

Here are some of my skills and experience:

- I am proficient in Excel, Power Query, VBA, SQL, AHK, Bash, Python, and PowerShell. 
- I have contributed to Meta AIâ€™s Pytorch project by creating a pull request and having my code merged.
- Some of my personal projects are:
  - leukoRight: A Keras model that recognizes white blood cells from microscopic images with 95% accuracy.
  - cashTrack: Created purely via prompt engineering techniquesâ€”cashTrack helps you manage expenses with a friend or family member easily using Signal Messenger.
  - The Amari Project: A project that generates similar faces with Stable Diffusion and Facial Recognition technology, and then creates a model of a face that never existed using textual inversion.
- In a previous role, I created a user interface system with data dashboards for inventory tracking and transfer using QR code labels, saving $20,000 for the company. I also automated real-time test volume and employee metrics using Microsoft Teams and SharePoint, providing data-driven insights for leadership decisions.
